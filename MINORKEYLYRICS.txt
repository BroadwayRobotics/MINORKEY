VERSE 1
This song isn't sad it's just in a minor key
It's a minor key
Sick and tired of wondering if you still think of me
What we could we be.
Do you think of me?

Satire and farce you know the joke's on me
Tears of a clown I bleed
You don't see me dance
Dancing so gracefully
In my dreams

CHORUS
In my dreams, behind your screens, 
you don't see I'm a Dancing Queen. 
In my dreams, writing scenes, 
Mother Fucking Dancing Queen. 


VERSE 2
My life isn't bad, I'm just his minor key
Hidden from reality
What would she say about me
If she knew that we unlocked the galaxy

Just you and me Dancing happilly across the screen
Veiled by perceived reality
Do you know about me
His minor key
I'm just his minor key
